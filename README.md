# NEYA_website
Website for NEYA (New England Youth Alliance). NOTE: Still a work in progress.

This is a website I volunteered to create for a non-profit organization called NEYA (New England Youth Alliance).  
This site is still a work in progress and not live yet.  I'm currently hosting it on my college server account.

I took my first web development course in the 2016 Spring Semester of my sophomore year at Wellesley College. 
The NEYA site is my first independent project since completing the course.
